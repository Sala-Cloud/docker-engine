# Introduction to Docker

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. This chapter introduces Docker's core concepts and use cases.

## What is Docker?

Docker allows developers to package applications into containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and isolated from the host system, making them ideal for running applications consistently across environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Containers**: Lightweight, portable units for running applications.
- **Images**: Read-only templates for creating containers.
- **Docker Engine**: The runtime responsible for building and running containers.

## Benefits of Using Docker

- Portability across environments.
- Scalability for distributed applications.
- Simplified CI/CD workflows.
