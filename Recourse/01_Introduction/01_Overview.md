# Docker Engine Overview

Docker Engine is an open-source containerization technology for building and containerizing your applications. It operates as a client-server application with the following core components:

- **Docker Daemon (dockerd):** A server with a long-running process that handles requests from clients and manages Docker objects, such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
- **Docker API:** APIs that specify interfaces for applications to interact with the Docker daemon, enabling control over container operations.
- **Docker CLI (docker):** The command-line client that uses Docker APIs for scripting and direct CLI commands to interact with the daemon. Many Docker tools and applications rely on this API and CLI.

The Docker daemon plays a key role in creating and managing Docker objects, making containerized application deployment and management efficient and scalable.

> For more details, see the [Docker Architecture Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/architecture/).

## Key Features of Docker Engine

1. **Installation**  
   Learn how to install Docker Engine for your specific platform by following the [installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Storage**  
   Docker provides options to use persistent data with containers, ensuring data retention across container lifecycle events.

3. **Networking**  
   Docker manages network connections between containers and allows container-to-host networking for seamless communication.

4. **Container Logs**  
   Tools and commands are available for viewing and managing logs from containers, making troubleshooting and monitoring easier.

5. **Pruning**  
   Use Docker's pruning tools to clean up unused resources like images, containers, and networks, freeing up system resources.

6. **Daemon Configuration**  
   Docker offers extensive configuration options for the Docker daemon, allowing you to customize it for your specific environment.

7. **Rootless Mode**  
   Docker supports running containers without root privileges, enhancing the security of containerized applications.

8. **Deprecated Features**  
   Some Docker Engine features are deprecated over time; be sure to check the latest documentation for any features to avoid.

9. **Release Notes**  
   Read the [release notes](https://docs.docker.com/release-notes/) for the latest updates and fixes in Docker Engine.

10. **Licensing**  
    Docker Engine is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. However, for commercial use of Docker Engine via Docker Desktop (for enterprises exceeding 250 employees or $10 million in revenue), a paid subscription is required.

Docker Engine is a powerful, flexible, and scalable solution for containerized application management across a variety of environments, making it a cornerstone of modern software deployment.
